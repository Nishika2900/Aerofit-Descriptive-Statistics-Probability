# Aerofit Descriptive Statistics & Probability Analysis

## Objective
The objective of this project is to perform descriptive statistics and probability analysis on the Aerofit dataset. This analysis helps in understanding the relationship between variables like Age, Gender, Education, Marital Status, Usage, Fitness, Income, and Miles.

## Dataset Information
- **Product:** Type of product purchased.
- **Age:** Age of the customer.
- **Gender:** Gender of the customer.
- **Education:** Number of years of education.
- **Marital Status:** Marital status of the customer.
- **Usage:** Usage of the product.
- **Fitness:** Self-reported fitness score.
- **Income:** Annual income of the customer.
- **Miles:** Number of miles the customer expects to run.

## Data Preprocessing
1. **Loading Data:** Load the dataset using pandas.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing values and outliers.
3. **Data Transformation:** Create new features like income categories and age categories.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
1. **Descriptive Statistics:**
    - Summary statistics for numerical and categorical columns.
    - Value counts for categorical columns.

2. **Visualizations:**
    - Box plots to visualize distribution and outliers.
    - Bar plots to show relationships between categorical variables.
    - Cross-tabulations to understand distribution across different variables.

## Probability Analysis
1. **Binomial Distribution:** 
    - Analysis of fitness scores based on gender and marital status.
2. **Normal Distribution:**
    - Analysis of income distribution and creation of income categories.

## Achievements
- **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Successfully handled missing values and outliers.
- **Descriptive Statistics:** Provided detailed insights into the dataset using summary statistics.
- **Visualizations:** Created various visualizations to understand relationships between variables.
- **Probability Analysis:** Applied binomial and normal distributions to analyze fitness scores and income.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python:** Programming language used.
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
- **Seaborn:** For statistical data visualization.
- **Matplotlib:** For plotting graphs.
- **Scipy:** For scientific and technical computing.
